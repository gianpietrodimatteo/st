----------
Same selection color background (foreground remains the same)

OpenClipboard (open copied url)
------------
Mod+o to open whats in the clipboard selection

Keyboard Select
-----------
When you run "keyboard_select", you have 3 modes available :

move mode : to set the start of the selection;
select mode : to activate and set the end of the selection;
input mode : to enter the search criteria.
Shortcuts for move and select modes :

 h, j, k, l:    move cursor left/down/up/right (also with arrow keys)
 !, _, *:       move cursor to the middle of the line/column/screen
 Backspace, $:  move cursor to the beginning/end of the line
 PgUp, PgDown : move cursor to the beginning/end of the column
 Home, End:     move cursor to the top/bottom left corner of the screen
 /, ?:          activate input mode and search up/down
 n, N:          repeat last search, up/down
 s:             toggle move/selection mode
 t:             toggle regular/rectangular selection type
 Return:        quit keyboard_select, keeping the highlight of the selection
 Escape:        quit keyboard_select
With h,j,k,l (also with arrow keys), you can use a quantifier. Enter a number before hitting the appropriate key.

Shortcuts for input mode :

 Return:       Return to the previous mode

CopyUrl
------------
Select and copy the last URL displayed with Mod1+l. Multiple invocations cycle through the available URLs.

Alpha
-----------
Allows transparency. Can be set in the alpha parameter that can also be set in Xresources.

Anysize
----------
This patch allows st to resize to any pixel size, makes the inner border size dynamic, and centers the content of the terminal so that the left/right and top/bottom borders are balanced. With this patch, st on a tiling WM will always fill the entire space allocated to it.

Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):
Remember to delete config.h (or backup it whatever) before trying out new patches

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
